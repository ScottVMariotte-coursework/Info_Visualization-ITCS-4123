One thing I noticed is that there is a lot of missing data and it seems
that when adding the populations up they don't seem to match what's on record when I google state populations on the internet.\
This caused me to think that there was something wrong with my code but I don't think that is the case.

One thing I noticed is that North Carolina showed up as having a lot of deaths but when you look at the deaths_per_100000 it
appears to be a little below the average.

I think the visualization of this data could be misleading. It looks like there  may be missing 
information based on what I saw from the total_population data.

I used data from https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/sanfranciso-crime-dataset

This data was on Sanfranciso Crime and included 10 columns.

I graphed the time that crimes where perpetrated. Each bar represents one hour out of the day starting from midnight am on the left and ending at 11 pm on the right.
